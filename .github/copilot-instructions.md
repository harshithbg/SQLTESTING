This repository stores frequently used SQL queries.

Database contains thousands of tables so table definitions are not stored here.

Guidelines:

1. Prefer reusing queries from the queries/ folder
2. Follow similar structure as existing queries
3. Use clear WHERE conditions
4. Always include date filters if applicable
5. Avoid SELECT *
6. Prefer readable aliases

When user asks for a query:
- Search repository first
- Reuse similar queries
- Modify instead of rewriting
